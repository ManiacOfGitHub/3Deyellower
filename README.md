# 3Deyellower
Blast your Nintendo 3DS screen with white for hours and pray that you don't destroy it.

# Usage
1. Power off your console
2. Insert your SD card into your computer
3. Copy `3Deyellower.firm` to the `/luma/payloads/` folder on your SD card
4. Reinsert your SD card into your console
5. Press and hold `START`, and while holding `START`, power on your console.
6. Select `3Deyellower`

Press `A` to start the torture, press `X` to access settings on the main menu, and press `B` or the power button at any time to power off.

During the test, hold `A` to see a progress bar. The console will automatically power off when the process has completed.

# Default Settings

The default settings have the program show a white screen for 2 hours, turn off the screen (to avoid damage) for 10 minutes, and repeat that 12 times. This means the whole test should take approximately 25 hours and 50 minutes.

Warning: These values are not well tested. If you have a suggestion on how they should be changed, please let me know on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) in the #hardware channel.
